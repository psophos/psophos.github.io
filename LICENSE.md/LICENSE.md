###Purpose

The idea here is to have a few documents detailing a list of Windows Server
troubleshooting and config steps around AD, DNS and whatever else crops up.

Some of this has come from hanging out on the [Spiceworks Community](https://community.spiceworks.com) page
for a while and seeing the same issues crop up over and over. Leads me to
believe that there is a need for a source of basic preventative maintenance
and/or troubleshooting information. Stuff that the exam preps don't always
cover.
The sort of stuff that people don't know that they need to know until
it is (usually) too late.

Other sources are available. Probably.

It's also a convenient excuse to learn some GitHub while I'm at it.
And Markdown. And probably other stuff too. Git most likely.
